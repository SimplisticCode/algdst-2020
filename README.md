# Algorithms & Data Structures

This is the repository for source code in the Algorithms & Data Structures course offered to Computer Engineering students in Fall 2020.

Some of the implementations are direct adaptations of the code made available [with the 4h edition of Weiss' book on Algorithms](https://users.cis.fiu.edu/~weiss/dsaa_c++4/code/).
